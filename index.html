                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Rana Thakur</strong> — an AI Specialist and Data Scientist with over two decades of experience turning complex ideas into practical, high-impact AI solutions.</p>
                    
                        <p>My career spans designing <strong>Generative AI, LLM, and Machine Learning</strong> systems that help organizations work smarter, faster, and more securely. I’ve worked on everything from <strong>fine-tuning Llama models</strong> for secure, in-house AI assistants to <strong>building multi-agent RAG systems</strong> that deliver context-aware answers in real time.</p>
                    
                        <p>I believe AI should be <strong>responsible, explainable, and useful</strong> — not just a buzzword. That’s why I focus on solutions that respect <strong>privacy, security, fairness, and ethics</strong>, while still pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
                    
                        <p>Outside of work, I love <strong>sharing knowledge</strong> through my blogs and contributing to <strong>open-source AI libraries</strong> that make advanced tools more accessible to the community. My open-source projects reflect my belief in collaboration — the idea that the best solutions are often built together.</p>
                    
                        <p>When I’m not coding or writing, you might find me exploring new technologies, experimenting with AI-powered workflows, or mentoring teams to help them get the most out of AI.</p>
                    
                        <p>If you’re looking for someone who can <strong>bridge business needs with cutting-edge AI technology</strong> — and deliver solutions that actually work in production — let’s connect.</p>
